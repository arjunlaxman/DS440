# DS440 â€“ Ethereum Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

This repository contains the final capstone project for DS440W at The Pennsylvania State University. Our goal was to design a scalable, hybrid system for detecting vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts using both deep learning models and static analysis tools.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

We combined pretrained transformer models and static analyzers to automatically detect, classify, and even suggest fixes for vulnerabilities in Solidity contracts.

### Key Technologies Used
- **CodeBERT** â€“ for classification of secure vs. vulnerable contracts.
- **GraphCodeBERT** â€“ enhanced detection using data flow graphs.
- **CodeT5+** â€“ added generative capabilities to suggest security patches.
- **Slither** â€“ static analysis for rule-based bug detection (e.g., reentrancy).

### Main Contributions
- Developed a multi-model ML pipeline with token, graph, and generative layers.
- Integrated Slither to catch rule-based issues missed by ML.
- Achieved validation accuracy of up to **77.6%**.
- Detected 29 new bugs missed by standard tools.
